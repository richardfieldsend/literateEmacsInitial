# Literate Emacs Initialisation.

This is my Emacs initialisation setup which is intended to work for
all my computers.

The computers in question are:

* An old Dell laptop running Linux Mint Tricia (19.3) - home.

* Desktop computer running Ubuntu 18.4 - home.

* A Raspberry Pi 2 computer running headlessly.

* An iMac desktop running Linux Mint Tricia (19.3) - work.

The main configuration file is built using Org-Mode to create a
literate programming configuration file.
